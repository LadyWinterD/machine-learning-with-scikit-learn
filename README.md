**Type of machine learning systems**

Supervised/unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning and reinforcement learning.

**Supervised learning:** 

1, learning task is classification.

2. predict a target numeric value.given a set of features called predictors.\(Age, brand, etc.\)The sort of task is regression.To train this system, you need to give it many examples.

Supervised learning algorithms:

* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Linear Regression
* Logistic regression
* Support vector machines
* Decision tree and random forests
* Neural networks

**Unsupervised learning algorithms:**

• Clustering 

—K-Means

 —DBSCAN

 —Hierarchical Cluster Analysis \(HCA\) 

• Anomaly detection and novelty detection 

—One-class SVM 

—Isolation Forest

 • Visualization and dimensionality reduction

 —Principal Component Analysis \(PCA\) 

—Kernel PCA —Locally Linear Embedding \(LLE\) 

—t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding \(t-SNE\)

 • Association rule learning 

—Apriori 

—Eclat

**Feature extraction: dimensionality reduction.**
